## Getting Started
To use this code, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. I recommend using Visual Studio Code as your code editor, and MinGW as your C++ compiler.

To download the code from this repository, simply clone it to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/cpp-programming.git
  
  Once you have the code on your computer, you can compile and run it using your C++ compiler.

## Code Structure
The code in this repository is organized into directories based on topic. Here is a brief overview of each directory:
 Markup : 1. A numbered list
              1. A nested numbered list
              2. Which is numbered
          2. Which is numbered
basics: Contains basic C++ programs, such as hello world and simple arithmetic operations.
arrays: Contains programs related to arrays, such as sorting and searching algorithms.
linked-lists: Contains programs related to linked lists, such as inserting and deleting nodes.
stacks: Contains programs related to stacks, such as implementing a stack using an array or a linked list.
queues: Contains programs related to queues, such as implementing a queue using an array or a linked list.
trees: Contains programs related to trees, such as traversing a binary tree and finding the height of a tree.
sorting: Contains programs related to sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort and merge sort.
searching: Contains programs related to searching algorithms, such as binary search and linear search.
graphs: Contains programs related to graph algorithms, such as depth-first search and breadth-first search.
Each directory contains one or more C++ files, and each file contains a program related to the topic of the directory.
